Flash Clock Panel v1.1

How to install:

1. Unpack the archive
2. Upload the folder "flach clock panel" to your infusions dir on your server.
3. Go to Administration -> System Admin -> Panels and add "flash_clock_panel" as a new panel.
4. Remember to activate the new panel, after you made it.

If you want to change something, you must manually edit the
flash_clock_panel/settings.php file. It should be pretty self explanatory.

129 flash clocks is included in this package. I haven't tested them all, so
there might be a couple of them not working.

*CHANGES*

v1.1:
	+Added the possibility to make background transparent in the settings.php file.
